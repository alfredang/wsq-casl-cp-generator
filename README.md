## Features

### Prepare CP (AI-Powered Content Generation)

Enter a course title and topics, then generate professional content for each CP section:

- **About This Course** -- Professional course description (80-120 words)
- **What You'll Learn** -- Bullet-point learning outcomes
- **Background Part A** -- Targeted sectors, audience, and training needs
- **Background Part B** -- Performance gaps, identification methods, and learner benefits
- **Learning Outcomes** -- One learning outcome per topic (T1/LO1 format)
- **Instructional Methods** -- Elaboration on appropriateness of each selected method
- **Assessment Methods** -- Elaboration on appropriateness of each selected assessment

### Submit CP

- **Course Outline** -- Topics, instructional methods, and duration per topic
- **Min Entry Requirements** -- Minimum entry requirements (knowledge, skills, attitude, experience)
- **Job Roles** -- 10 relevant job roles following SSG Skills Framework naming
- **Lesson Plan** -- Auto-generated schedule with barrier algorithm (lunch, assessment, day-end splits), downloadable as Word (.docx) and PDF (.pdf) with 4-column table layout
- **CP Quality Audit** -- Upload CP Excel to compare against saved course details, highlights mismatches, and generates downloadable audit report (.docx)

### Course Details

Configure course parameters used across all sections:

- CASL/WSQ mode selector with mode-specific fields (Unique Skill Name for CASL, TSC Reference Code/Title for WSQ)
- Course duration, number of topics, instructional/assessment hours
- CASL mode allows 0 assessment methods/duration
- Select instructional methods (19 options) and assessment methods (11 options)
- AI-powered course topic generation (CASL mode uses skill descriptions from CSV for context)
- Auto-calculated duration per topic, per method
